# calculator
Design a simple working calculator


Code follows the pattern of first dealing with num1 then operator and then num2, when backspace is pressed
the same pattern moves in backward direction
The code is trashy as the methods are heavily dependent on one another. I will try to keep that in mind, in
future.
